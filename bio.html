	<h1>Aman Navani's Biography</h1>
	<p>My name is Aman Navani and I am currently a sophomore at Tufts University. My academic interests are Computer Science and Mathematics, but I also enjoy studying spanish in the non-technical front. My non-academic interests include playing squash and playing video games.
